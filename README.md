# Proj-Horiseon-Refac
This repository holds the code to a fictional marketing website for a class assignment :P
## Description
This project is first of many that I will work on durring this coding bootcamp. In this project I 
refactored some provided code (starter code) by adding alt text elements to all images, helping the website 
meet accesibility requirements. Additionaly,  css and html code was rewritten to prevent repition and improve overall consolidation of the code, while ensuring local website links worked properly. Additionally this project helped me learn about code organization skills as we are required to implement methods such as "scout" and "DRY".
